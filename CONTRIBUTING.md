# Contribute to TTS-API

Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. Code
contributions are not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping
others, and improving the documentation are also immensely valuable.

However you choose to contribute, please be mindful and respect our
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

**This guide was heavily inspired by the awesome [transformers guide to contributing](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).**

## Ways to contribute

There are several ways you can contribute:

* Fix outstanding issues with the existing code.
* Submit issues related to bugs or desired new features.
* Contribute to the examples or to the documentation.

If you don't know where to start, there is a special [Good First
Issue](https://github.com/projecte-aina/tts-api/contribute) listing. It will give you a list of
open issues that are beginner-friendly and help you start contributing to open-source. The best way to do that is to open a Pull Request and link it to the issue that you'd like to work on. We try to give priority to opened PRs as we can easily track the progress of the fix, and if the contributor does not have time anymore, someone else can take the PR over.

For something slightly more challenging, you can also take a look at the [Good Second Issue](/labels/Good%20Second%20Issue) list. In general though, if you feel like you know what you're doing, go for it and we'll help you get there! üöÄ

> All contributions are equally valuable to the community. ü•∞

## Fixing outstanding issues

If you notice an issue with the existing code and have a fix in mind, feel free to [start contributing](#create-a-pull-request) and open a Pull Request!

## Submitting a bug-related issue or feature request

Do your best to follow these guidelines when submitting a bug-related issue or a feature
request. It will make it easier for us to come back to you quickly and with good
feedback.

### Did you find a bug?

Before you report an issue, we would really appreciate it if you could **make sure the bug was not
already reported** (use the search bar on GitHub under Issues). Your issue should also be related to bugs in the project itself, and not your code. If you're unsure whether the bug is in your code or the project, please ask in the [Discussions](https://github.com/projecte-aina/tts-api/discussions) first. This helps us respond quicker to fixing issues related to the project versus general questions.

Once you've confirmed the bug hasn't already been reported, please include the following information in your issue so we can quickly resolve it:

* Your **OS type and version** and **Python**, **PyTorch** and versions when applicable.
* A short, self-contained, code snippet that allows us to reproduce the bug in
  less than 30s.
* The *full* traceback if an exception is raised.
* Attach any other additional information, like screenshots, you think may help.


### Do you want a new feature?

If there is a new feature you'd like to see in this project, please open an issue and describe:

1. What is the *motivation* behind this feature? Is it related to a problem or frustration with the project? Is it a feature related to something you need for a project? Is it something you worked on and think it could benefit the community?

   Whatever it is, we'd love to hear about it!

2. Describe your requested feature in as much detail as possible. The more you can tell us about it, the better we'll be able to help you.
3. Provide a *code snippet* that demonstrates the features usage.
4. If the feature is related to a paper, please include a link.

If your issue is well written we're already 80% of the way there by the time you create it.


## Do you want to add documentation?

We're always looking for improvements to the documentation that make it more clear and accurate. Please let us know how the documentation can be improved such as typos and any content that is missing, unclear or inaccurate. We'll be happy to make the changes or help you make a contribution if you're interested!


## Create a Pull Request

Before writing any code, we strongly advise you to search through the existing PRs or
issues to make sure nobody is already working on the same thing. If you are
unsure, it is always a good idea to open an issue to get some feedback.

You will need basic `git` proficiency to contribute to.
While `git` is not the easiest tool to use, it has the greatest
manual. Type `git --help` in a shell and enjoy! If you prefer books, [Pro
Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a very good reference.

You'll need **Python 3.10** or above to contribute to. Follow the steps below to start contributing:

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/projecte-aina/tts-api/) by
   clicking on the **[Fork](https://github.com/projecte-aina/tts-api/fork)** button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the code
   under your GitHub user account.

2. Clone your fork to your local disk, and add the base repository as a remote:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:<your Github handle>/tts-api.git
   cd tts-api
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/projecte-aina/tts-api.git
   ```

3. Create a new branch to hold your development changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes
   ```

   üö® **Do not** work on the `main` branch!

4. To set up a development environment you have the following options:

    - Manually install the dependences and setup the environment, follow the steps at [README](https://github.com/projecte-aina/tts-api?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
    
    - Develop in docker with autoreload, follow the steps available at the [DEVELOPER MODE](https://github.com/projecte-aina/tts-api?tab=readme-ov-file#develop-in-docker) section 


5. Develop the features in your branch.

   As you work on your code, you should make sure the test suite
   passes. Run the tests impacted by your changes like this:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

   Once you're happy with your changes, add the changed files with `git add` and
   record your changes locally with `git commit`:

   ```bash
   git add modified_file.py
   git commit
   ```

   Please remember to write [good commit
   messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) to clearly communicate the changes you made!

   To keep your copy of the code up to date with the original
   repository, rebase your branch on `upstream/branch` *before* you open a pull request or if requested by a maintainer:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

   Push your changes to your branch:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes
   ```

   If you've already opened a pull request, you'll need to force push with the `--force` flag. Otherwise, if the pull request hasn't been opened yet, you can just push your changes normally.

6. Now you can go to your fork of the repository on GitHub and click on **Pull Request** to open a pull request. Make sure you tick off all the boxes on our [checklist](#pull-request-checklist) below. When you're ready, you can send your changes to the project maintainers for review.

7. It's ok if maintainers request changes, it happens to our core contributors
   too! So everyone can see the changes in the pull request, work in your local
   branch and push the changes to your fork. They will automatically appear in
   the pull request.

### Pull request checklist

‚òê The pull request title should summarize your contribution.<br>
‚òê If your pull request addresses an issue, please mention the issue number in the pull
request description to make sure they are linked (and people viewing the issue know you
are working on it).<br>
‚òê To indicate a work in progress please prefix the title with `[WIP]`. These are
useful to avoid duplicated work, and to differentiate it from PRs ready to be merged.<br>
‚òê Make sure existing tests pass.<br>
‚òê If adding a new feature, also add tests for it.<br>


### Style guide

For documentation strings, this project follows the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).


### Develop on Windows

On Windows (unless you're working in [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or WSL), you need to configure git to transform Windows `CRLF` line endings to Linux `LF` line endings:

```bash
git config core.autocrlf input
```

One way to run the `make` command on Windows is with MSYS2:

1. [Download MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), and we assume it's installed in `C:\msys64`.
2. Open the command line `C:\msys64\msys2.exe` (it should be available from the **Start** menu).
3. Run in the shell: `pacman -Syu` and install `make` with `pacman -S make`.
4. Add `C:\msys64\usr\bin` to your PATH environment variable.

You can now use `make` from any terminal (PowerShell, cmd.exe, etc.)! üéâ

### Sync a forked repository with upstream main

When updating the main branch of a forked repository, please follow these steps to avoid pinging the upstream repository which adds reference notes to each upstream PR, and sends unnecessary notifications to the developers involved in these PRs.

1. When possible, avoid syncing with the upstream using a branch and PR on the forked repository. Instead, merge directly into the forked main.
2. If a PR is absolutely necessary, use the following steps after checking out your branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-for-syncing
   git pull --squash --no-commit upstream main
   git commit -m '<your message without GitHub references>'
   git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-for-syncing
   ```
